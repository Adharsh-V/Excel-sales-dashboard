This project showcases an end‑to‑end sales analysis in Excel using:

* Macro recording for automated tasks (refreshing data, updating pivots, resetting filters).

* Slicers and checkboxes for interactive filtering and dynamic views.

* Pivot tables and pivot charts for summarized insights.

* A variety of charts (column, line, bar, pie, combo) to highlight key KPIs and trends.

* The dashboard is designed for quick decision‑making by business users without needing any external BI tool.
